This is GitHub site of MattMS!</p><p>This gives an overview of my projects on GitHub,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/MattMS/mattms.github.io">including this site</a>.</p><p>If you are curious about other aspects of myself, you may prefer to
read&nbsp;<a href="http://about.mattms.info/">my about page</a>.</p><h2>Configurations</h2><p>Discover how I bend various pieces of software to my will.</p><h3>Fish</h3><p>I'm not a big fan of the command line, but&nbsp;<a href="http://fishshell.com/">Fish shell</a> is the nicest I've used so far.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/MattMS/my-fish-config">My Fish configuration</a> is pretty basic, which I'll credit to Fish being great to begin with.</p><h3>Lubuntu</h3><p>I like a simple OS, and&nbsp;<a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> is currently what I have settled on.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/MattMS/my-lubuntu-config">My Lubuntu configuration</a> mostly just contains keyboard shortcuts that I settled on over time.
I also reformatted a few of the comments to make it easier for me to
read.</p><h3>Vim</h3><p><a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> is the last editor I switched to and never looked back.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/MattMS/my-vim-config">My Vim configuration</a> will probably change the most frequently compared to my other
configurations on here.
This is because I use it daily and I'm always seeking more efficent
ways to do things.</p></div></body></html>
