# Hello world!

Weary traveller of the Internet, you have arrived at a safe place.

Here you may casually browse a select few of my projects from GitHub,
[including this site](https://github.com/MattMS/mattms.github.io).

If you are curious about other aspects of myself, you may prefer
[my about page](http://about.mattms.info/).


## Command-line tools

These are mostly [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) apps that I have created for my own needs.
Maybe you have similar needs?


### Chuck me

[Chuck me](https://github.com/MattMS/chuckme)
is the tool that no professional should be without.

Some people may have thought that it could be the single greatest tool that humankind has ever known.


### Deg

[Deg](https://github.com/MattMS/deg)
does conversions between decimal degrees and degrees-minutes-seconds.
You can even [use it online](https://mattms.github.io/deg/).


### Jader

[Jader](https://mattms.github.io/jader)
is a basic web server that serves compiled Jade templates that may include CoffeeScript, Markdown, and Stylus.


### Rediscan

[Rediscan](https://github.com/MattMS/rediscan)
came from desire for a quicker way to use [Redis](http://redis.io/) `SCAN`.

It exposes `SCAN` results via a web page with continuous scrolling.


### Shelp

[Shelp](https://github.com/MattMS/shelp#shell-help)
gives examples of how to use various Linux commands.


## Demo

Sometimes I just like doing little experiments.


### Coffee-gulp-bro

[CoffeeScript/Gulp/Browserify](https://github.com/MattMS/coffee_gulp_bro)
all in one tasty little package.
[Some](https://github.com/joshgillies) have claimed that Gulp many not even be necessary!
Maybe CoBro is a better name?


### WD42 talk

I have been known to visit [a friendly little meetup](http://web.dev42.co/).
One time, [I gave a talk](https://github.com/MattMS/WD42_CoffeeScript_talk).


### What's my age again?

[Convert your numbers](https://github.com/MattMS/whats_my_age_again)
to different bases.

Helps all those awkward chats with people not based in the same world as you.


## Learning

As I learn new things, I like to keep notes.
My thought is that leaving them in a public place will make them easier to find later.

It also lets you know if I know what you think I know.

- [Blender](https://github.com/MattMS/Blender_notes)

- [ColdFusion](https://github.com/MattMS/ColdFusion_notes)

- [CouchDB](https://github.com/MattMS/CouchDB_notes)

- [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/MattMS/Elasticsearch_notes)

- [Mercury](https://github.com/MattMS/mercury_demo)

- [Polymer](https://github.com/MattMS/Polymer_demo)

- [Python 3](https://github.com/MattMS/Python_3_notes)


## Libraries

Things that may be useful when stuffed into other things.


### Metah

Getting [meta (tags)](https://github.com/MattMS/metah)
has never been easier!


### Ramped.js

Heavily inspired by [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/).
[Ramped.js](https://github.com/MattMS/ramped.js)
is a collection of functions that take a slightly different approach to functional programming.


## Settings

Be amazed at how I bend various pieces of software to my will!


### Atom

I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) for most of my text editing these days.

[My Atom settings](https://github.com/MattMS/my_atom_settings)
are focused on making it behave the same as Vim.


### Fish

I'm not a big fan of the command line, but [Fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) is the pretty neat.

[My Fish settings](https://github.com/MattMS/my-fish-config)
are pretty basic, which I'll credit to Fish being great to begin with.


### Lubuntu

I like a simple OS, and [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) definitely qualifies.

[My Lubuntu settings](https://github.com/MattMS/my-lubuntu-config)
mostly just contains alternative keyboard shortcuts.
I also reformatted a few of the comments to make it easier to understand the options.


### Vim

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is hard to learn and harder to leave.

[My Vim settings](https://github.com/MattMS/my-vim-config)
contains a bunch of shortcuts and extensions I like to use.


## Sites

### About me

[My about page](http://about.mattms.info/)
aims to be my replacement to the standard resume.


### CSS

[My CSS repo](http://css.mattms.info/)
contains the CSS used to style each of my sites.


### Thoughts

[My thoughts](http://thoughts.mattms.info/)
contains various topics of interest that I am trying to resolve.
Consider it as my alternative to a blog.
