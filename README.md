# Hello world!

Weary traveller of the Internet, you have arrived at a safe place.
This is GitHub site of MattMS!

This gives an overview of my projects on GitHub,
[including this site](https://github.com/MattMS/mattms.github.io).

If you are curious about other aspects of myself, you may prefer to read
[my about page](http://about.mattms.info/).


## Command-line tools

### Chuckme

[Chuck me](https://github.com/MattMS/chuckme) is the tool that no web
professional should be without.

Some people may have thought that it could be the single greatest tool
that all humankind has ever known.


### Deg

[Deg](https://github.com/MattMS/deg#degrees-conversions) is a Node.js
app for converting between decimal degrees and degrees-minutes-seconds.


### Jader

[Jader](https://mattms.github.io/jader) is a basic web server that
serves compiled Jade templates with support for CoffeeScript and Stylus.


### Shelp

[Shelp](https://github.com/MattMS/shelp#shell-help) is a Node.js app for
printing examples of Linux commands.


## Configurations

Discover how I bend various pieces of software to my will.


### Fish

I'm not a big fan of the command line, but
[Fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) is the nicest I've used so far.

[My Fish configuration](https://github.com/MattMS/my-fish-config)
is pretty basic, which I'll credit to Fish being great to begin with.


### Lubuntu

I like a simple OS, and [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) is currently what
I have settled on.

[My Lubuntu configuration](https://github.com/MattMS/my-lubuntu-config)
mostly just contains keyboard shortcuts that I settled on over time.
I also reformatted a few of the comments to make it easier to read.


### Vim

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is the last editor I switched to and never
looked back.

[My Vim configuration](https://github.com/MattMS/my-vim-config)
contains a bunch of shortcuts and extensions I like to use.


## Example code

I have created repositories for common bits of code I have needed at
various times.

- [CoffeeScript/Gulp/Browserify](https://github.com/MattMS/coffee_gulp_bro)
  all in one tasty little package.
  [Some](https://github.com/joshgillies) have claimed that Gulp many not
  even be necessary!
  Maybe CoBro is a better name.

- [ColdFusion snippets](https://github.com/MattMS/ColdFusion_examples)
  for rapid pain relief.

- [Python 3](https://github.com/MattMS/Python_3_examples)

- [Web tricks](https://github.com/MattMS/web_tricks)


## Sites

### About me

[My about page](http://about.mattms.info/) aims to be my replacement to
the standard resume.


### CSS

[My CSS repo](http://css.mattms.info/) contains the CSS used to style
each of my sites.


### Thoughts

[My thoughts](http://thoughts.mattms.info/) contains various topics of
interest that I am trying to resolve.
Consider it as my alternative to a blog.
